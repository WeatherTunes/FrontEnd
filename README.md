###Issues while coding
This project took me awhile to come up with as a final project for GA SEIR bootcamp. So far I have created a foundation with information that I want the user to be presented with. After running into many errors with my backend to save user data, and APIs not functioning correctly, I wols strongly say that this is just a beta. I plan on deploying this on the App Store for iPhone users. This brought one main issue was I wanted to try to develope the fill applicaiton to be ready for market by then end of the seven day project time. I then realized that this would be very difficult to exicute as I would need to learn how to use React Native which I plan on developing over the next couple of weeks as I strongly believe that this is a fantastic idea.

**Current project status:** 
Beta 1.0 = pitch has been given to investors. recieved feed back and other ideas. Ready to start moving into utilizing React Native to form final product.
